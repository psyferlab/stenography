persistent listening ai stenographe for notes, simple functions with files 
like creating deleting moing appending, voice recogition through 
persistent access to your microphone. 

could integrate anything such as chatgpt, quivr-like personal brain 
software, voice recognition, free buckets on web3, portable and can sync 
universally for consistent idea streams even when you move from desktop to 
mobile.

Certainly! Here's an Agile development plan for your software project:

### Sprint 1: Project Setup and Initial Research
- **Duration**: 2 weeks

#### Goals:
1. ~~Set up project repository and version control.~~
2. ~~Research and select primary technologies and frameworks.~~
3. ~~Define user stories and prioritize features.~~ (see /user-stories)
4. ~~Create wireframes/mockups for user interface.~~
5. ~~Establish communication channels and collaboration tools.~~

#### Tasks:
- ~~Set up Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).~~
- ~~Choose programming languages and frameworks (Python, Electron.js, etc.).~~
- ~~Draft user stories and prioritize them based on importance.~~
- ~~Create wireframes/mockups using tools like Figma or Sketch.~~
-~~Set up communication channels (Slack, Discord) and project management 
tools (Trello, Jira).~~

### Sprint 2: Foundational Development
- **Duration**: 3 weeks

#### Goals:
1. Implement basic file management functionalities.
2. Integrate initial speech-to-text functionality.
3. Set up microphone access and audio processing.
4. Develop basic UI components based on wireframes.
5. Begin integration with external APIs (e.g., ChatGPT).

#### Tasks:
- Implement file creation, deletion, and basic management functions.
- Integrate speech-to-text functionality using selected library/API.
- Set up microphone access and implement basic audio processing.
- Develop UI components for note-taking and basic file management.
- Start integrating with external APIs like ChatGPT for initial testing.

### Sprint 3: Feature Implementation and Testing
- **Duration**: 3 weeks

#### Goals:
1. Complete integration with external APIs and services.
2. Enhance file management functionalities.
3. Improve speech recognition accuracy and performance.
4. Implement cross-platform compatibility.
5. Begin testing for functionality and usability.

#### Tasks:
- Finish integrating with external APIs and services (personal brain 
software, Web3).
- Enhance file management features such as file moving and appending.
- Optimize speech recognition accuracy and performance.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility using Electron.js or similar 
frameworks.
- Begin testing for functionality and usability, addressing any bugs or 
issues.

### Sprint 4: Refinement and Iteration
- **Duration**: 2 weeks

#### Goals:
1. Iterate based on user feedback and testing results.
2. Refine UI/UX based on user testing.
3. Optimize performance and address any remaining issues.
4. Prepare for initial release or beta testing.

#### Tasks:
- Gather and analyze user feedback from testing.
- Make iterative improvements to UI/UX based on feedback.
- Optimize software performance and address any remaining bugs.
- Prepare documentation for initial release or beta testing.

### Sprint 5: Final Polish and Release
- **Duration**: 1 week

#### Goals:
1. Perform final testing and quality assurance.
2. Address any last-minute issues or bugs.
3. Prepare marketing materials and documentation.
4. Launch the initial release or beta version.

#### Tasks:
- Conduct final testing and QA to ensure readiness for release.
- Address any last-minute bugs or issues.
- Prepare marketing materials, such as website content and social media 
announcements.
- Release the initial version to selected users for beta testing or 
general availability.

### Sprint Review and Planning Meeting
- **Duration**: 1 week (at the end of each sprint)

#### Goals:
1. Review completed tasks and achievements.
2. Gather feedback from team members.
3. Plan for the next sprint based on feedback and project progress.

#### Tasks:
- Conduct a retrospective meeting to review the sprint's accomplishments.
- Gather feedback from team members on what went well and what could be 
improved.
- Plan the next sprint, adjusting priorities and tasks based on feedback 
and project goals.

This Agile development plan provides a structured approach to iteratively 
develop and refine your software project while continuously gathering 
feedback and adapting to changes. Adjust the duration and specific tasks 
as needed based on the project's scope and requirements.
